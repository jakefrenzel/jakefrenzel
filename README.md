## 🧩 Project Details
### 🛡️ Jake's CyberLab
- Building a personal **Cybersecurity and IT Networking lab** to explore tools, simulate real-world environments, and gain hands-on experience in system administration, network design, and security testing
- Continuously expanding the lab with new technologies and challenges to strengthen practical skills in threat analysis, incident response, and secure infrastructure management.
### 🚩 CyberCTF Platform
- Building a full-stack Capture The Flag (CTF) platform designed for hosting and managing cybersecurity competitions, allowing organizers to create events and participants to compete, track progress, and solve challenges.
- Implementing secure authentication with JWT, role-based access control, competition/challenge management, real-time flag submission, and an admin dashboard - powered by Django REST Framework on the backend and Next.js with TypeScript on the frontend.
### 👑 CrownWynn
- Creating a secure, provably fair casino platform that builds on my first project, *Keno Gambino*, using cryptographic systems and real-time integrity checks.
- Implementing cryptographic random number generation and verifiable hash-based checks to ensure true randomness and integrity — similar to systems used in real online casinos.
### 🌐 Jake's Personal Portfolio Site
- I’m building a personal portfolio website to highlight my projects, skills, and experience
- Built from scratch with Astro, this project challenges me to explore modern web development practices while refining my frontend design and development skills.
### 🏓 CourtsPro 
- CourtsPro is a full-stack web application built to manage pickleball court operations, including reservations, event scheduling, and court availability tracking.
- It provides a streamlined interface for both players and administrators, simplifying facility management and improving the overall user experience.
